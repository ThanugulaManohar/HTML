<p>Orville and Wilbur Wright, known as the Wright brothers, were American aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane. On December 17, 1903, they made their first powered, sustained, and controlled airplane flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.</p>
<p>They were self-taught engineers who studied the flight of birds and applied principles of aerodynamics to develop a machine that could fly with a pilot aboard. Their success marked the beginning of the modern aviation era.</p>

<h2>Inventions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>1903 Wright Flyer</b> – The first successful powered aircraft.</li>
    <li><b>Three-Axis Control System</b> – Allowed the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and maintain its equilibrium.</li>
    <li><b>Wind Tunnel Testing</b> – Pioneered accurate aerodynamic testing for aircraft parts.</li>
    <li><b>Propeller Design</b> – Developed efficient propellers based on aerodynamic principles.</li>
    <li><b>Wright Flyer II & III</b> – Improved models that allowed longer and more controlled flights.</li>
</ul>
